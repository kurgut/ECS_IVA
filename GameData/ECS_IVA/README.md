ASET interactive IVA for a variant of the stock external command seat

- Installation : 
Merge the zip's GameData folder with your KSP/GameData folder.

- Dependencies :
Module Manager
ASET Consolidated Props and Avionics
RasterPropMonitor

- Optional and recommended :
NearfutureProps: adds a few decorative elemetents (just the post it s)

- NOTE / USAGE : 
	To make this IVA possible, this mod adds a variant of the stock External Command Seat, by changing it to a pod-like behavior.
So you can enter/exit it with a hatch on the side. This has one drawback :  the Kerbal isn't visible in the external view anymore. 
I could go around this by adding a B9PSwitch model of the Kerbal for the player to turn ON/OFF at his convenience, I'll see.
Alternatively and for now, you can enable the IVA overlay, which is already cool in it self and arguably better in one sense, since it will display the props too.
	Has a patch if Through the Eyes of of Kerbal mod is installed, to apply this IVA to the STOCK ext cmd seat, however it will only display
the props if interior overlay is turned ON. Some feature will not work and the textures are "eaten" by the kerbal's helmet, which is larger than the internal one.
This will maybe evolve upon time, if TTE updates and integrate this in the future, if it's even possible.
