	description = Alternate version of the stock ext cmd seat, with an interactive ASET IVA. NOTE: This behave like a pod : you can enter/exit with a hatch like any other command pod. Note that for now, there's no model of the Kerbal on this external view, you can enable interior overlay to have it. You can change the control point to default / reversed / Up, depending if you use it as a plane/rover or orbiter/lander.
